# Code for the Data Analysis Feature of the WMS
#
# Data analysis is used to process and interpret the data collected from 
# sensors and other sources. This feature helps in making informed decisions
# and improving the efficiency of the waste collection system. 
# It can: 
#  > Identify high-waste areas and peak waste generation times. 
#  > Predict future waste generation trends. 
#  > Generate reports and visualisations for better understanding. 
#
# Implementation Steps -->
#  1. Data Collection: Collect data from sensors, GPS, and historical records.
#  2. Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis. 
#  3. Analysis: Use statistical and ML techniques to analyse waste generation
#     patterns and predict future trends.
#  4. Visualisation: Create visualisations to present the analysis results.
#  5. Reporting: Generate reports to help in decision-making. 
#
# Tools and Technologies --> 
#  > Programming Language: Python, R
#  > Libraries: 
#      a. Pandas
#      b. NumPy
#      c. Scikit-learn for analysis
#      d. Matplotlib
#      e. Seaborn for visualisation
#  > Database: SQL or NoSQL databases
