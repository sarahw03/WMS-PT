Planning and Scheduling Waste Management System 

1. Requirements
    > Key Features: 
        a. Scheduling
        b. Route Optimisation 
        c. Waste Monitoring 
    > Data Sources:
        a. Bin Locations
        b. Waste Levels
        c. Collection Schedules 

2. Architecture
    > System Architecture:
        a. Data Collection
        b. Processing
        c. User Interface (UI)
    > Hardware Components:
        a. Sensors for Bins 
    > Software Components

3. Data Collection
    > Sensors to monitor bin fill levels 
    > GPS for location tracking 
    > Collect data on waste generation patterns and bin usage 

4. Data Analysis
    > Algorithms to analyse waste data and identify high-waste areas.
    > Machine Learning (ML) to predict which bins needs quicker collection. 

5. Scheduling and Optimisation
    > Algorithms for route optimisation to minimise travel time and fuel consumption.
    > Scheduling system that prioritises bins based on fill levels and waste generation patterns 

6. User Interface
    > User-friendly interface for waste company operators to view schedules and routes.
    > Web technologies for a responsive design: 
        a. HTML
        b. CSS
        c. JavaScript

7. Testing and Deployment 
    > Test the system thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability.
    > Deploy the system and monitor its performance, making adjustments as needed

Example Tools and Technologies --> 
    > Sensors: Use IoT sensors to monitor bin fill levels. 
    > GPS Tracking: Implement GPS tracking for route optimisation.
    > Data Analysis: Libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data processing, and Scikit-learn for ML.
    > Web Development: Frameworks like Flask or Django for Python, or Node.js for JavaScript. 

Additional Insights --> 
    > Route Optimisation Software: Tools like RouteSmart can help optimise waste collection routes. 
    > Key Performance Indictors (KPIs): Monitoring KPIs can improve the efficiency of the waste collection system. 
    > Real-Time Monitoring: Integrating real-time monitoring can streamline operations and enhance decision-making. 

Future Works --> 
1. Include Smart Bin 
    > Smart bins with a neural network (NN), camera for analysis of item in users hand and motors to ensure disposal of waste in correct section.
    > Bin has 3 sections: General, Recyclable and Organic Waste 
2. Correct Bin Section Collection 
    > Collection of full bin section by correct waste bin.
