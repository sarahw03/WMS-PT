# Code for the Scheduling Feature of the WMS 
#
# This feature allows waste collection companies to create and manage
# collection schedules. It ensures that bins are emptied at optimal times
# based on historical data and current fill levels. 
# The scheduling system can: 
#  > Automatically generate collection schedules. 
#  > Adjust schedules dynamically based on real-time data.
#  > Notify operators of upcoming collections and any changes. 
#
# Implementation Steps --> 
#  1. Data Collection: Gather data on bin locations, waste generation patterns
#     and current collection schedules. 
#  2. Algorithm Development: Develop algorithms to create optimal collection 
#     schedules based on bin fill levels and historical data. 
#  3. Dynamic Adjustments: Implement a system to dynamically adjust 
#     schedules based on real-time data from bin sensors. 
#  4. User Interface: Create a user interface for operatos to view and 
#     manage schedules. 
#  5. Notifications: Set up notifications to alert operators of upcoming 
#     collections and any schedule changes. 
#
# Tools and Technologies --> 
#  > Prgramming Language: Python, JavaScript 
#  > Libraries:
#      a. Pandas
#      b. NumPy for data analysis
#      c. Flask or Django for web development
#  > Database: SQL or NoSQL databases to store scheduling data.
