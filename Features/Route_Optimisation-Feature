# Code for the Route Optimisation Feature 
#
# Route optimisation is crucial for minimising travel time and fuel 
# consumption. This feature uses algorithms to determine the most efficient
# routes for waste collection trucks. 
# It can: 
#  > Calculate the shortest and fastest routes. 
#  > Consider factors like traffic conditions, road closures, and bin 
#    fill levels. 
#  > Provide real-time route adjustments to avoid delays. 
# 
# Implementation Steps --> 
#  1. Data Collection: Collect data on bin locations, road networks, and 
#     traffic conditions.
#  2. Algorithm Development: Use algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for shortest
#     path calculations and vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers for 
#     optimisation. 
#  3. Real-Time Adjustments: Implement real-time adjustments based on traffic 
#     data and bin fill levels. 
#  4. User Interface: Develop a map-based interface for operators to view
#     optimised routes. 
#  5. Integration: Integrate with GPS systems for real-time nagivation. 
#
# Tools and Technologies --> 
#  > Programming Langauges: Python, JavaScript
#  > Libraries: 
#      a. NetworkX for graph-based algorithms 
#      b. Google Maps API for mapping
#  > Optimisation Tools: OR-Tools by Google for VRP
