1. Define the Objectives
  > Identify Key Features - COMPLETED
  > Set Goals - Aim to achieve with the system, such as:
                i. Improving efficiency
                ii. Reducing costs
                iii. Enhancing service quality

2. Research and Planning
  > Market Research - Look into existing waste management systems to 
                      understand their strengths and weaknesses. 
  > Technical Research - Investigate the technologies and tools needed, such as:
                          i. Sensors
                          ii. Programming languages
                          iii. Software frameworks
  > Project Plan - Create a detailed project plan with timelines, milestones
                   and resource allocation. 

3. Design the System Architecture
  > System Components: Define the main components of the system, including: 
                i. Hardware (Sensors, GPS)
                ii. Software (Backend, Frontend)
                iii. Data Storage 
  > Data Flow: Plan how data will flow through the system, from data
               collection to processing and visualisation. 
  > Integration Points: Identify how the system will integrate with existing
                        systems and external services. 

4. Develop a Prototype
  > Start Small: Begin with a basic prototype that includes core functionalities
                 like data collection from sensors and a simple user interface.
  > Iterate: Gradually add more features, testing each one thoroughly before
             moving on to the next. 

5. Choose the Tools and Technologies
  > Programming Lanagauges: Select lanaguages that suit the needs
                            (e.g., Python for data analysis, JavaScript for
                            web interfaces).
  > Frameworks and Libraries: Use frameworks like Flask or Django for 
                              backend development and React or Angular 
                              for frontend development. 
  > Hardware: Choose reliable sensors and communication modules for waste
              monitoring. 

6. Develop and Test
  > Coding: Start coding the different components of the system.
  > Testing: Test each component individually and then test the system
             as a whole to ensure everything works together seamlessly. 
  > Feedback: Gather feedback from potential users and stakeholders to refine
              the system. 

7. Deploy and Maintain
  > Deployment: Deploy the system in a real-world environment, starting with 
                a pilot project if possible. 
  > Monitoring: Continuously monitor the system's performance and make 
                necessary adjustments. 
  > Maintenance: Regulary update the system to fix bugs, add new features, and
                 improve performance.

Features Prioritisation List 
  1. Waste Monitoring
    Why? This feature is crucial for collecting real-time data on bin fill
    levels, which is essential for all other functionalities. 

  2. Scheduling
    Why? Efficient scheduling ensures that bins are collected at optimal times, 
    reducing overflow and improving service efficiency.

  3. Route Optimisation
    Why? Optimising routes can significantly reduce travel time and fuel 
    consumption, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency.

  4. User Interface
    Why? A user-friendly interface is essential for operators to interact 
    with the system effectively.

  5. Notifications and Alerts
    Why? Keeping operators informed about the status of bins and the 
    collection process is crucial for timely interventions.

  6. Data Analysis
    Why? Analysing data helps in making informed decisions and improving the 
    efficiency of the waste collection system.
