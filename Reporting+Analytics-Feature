# Code for Reporting and Analytics Feature in the WMS
#
# This feature provides detailed reports and analytics on the performance
# of the waste collection system. It helps in identifying areas of 
# improvement and making data-driven decisions. 
# Reporting and analytics can: 
#  > Generate periodic reports on collection efficiency.
#  > Provide insights into waste generation patterns. 
#  > Highlight areas where the system can be optimised. 
#
# Implementation Steps --> 
#  1. Data Collection: Collect data from sensors, GPS, and historical records
#  2. Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis. 
#  3. Analysis: Use statistical and ML techniques to analyse waste generation
#     patterns and predict future trends. 
#  4. Visualisation: Create visualisation to present the analysis results. 
#  5. Reporting: Generate reports to help in decision-making. 
#
# Tools and Technologies --> 
#  > Programming Languages: Python, R 
#  > Libraries:
#      a. Pandas
#      b. NumPy
#      c. Scikit-learn for analysis
