# Code for the Integration with Existing Systems Feature in the WMS
#
# To ensure seamless operation, this feature allows the new system to 
# integrate with existing waste management systems and databases. 
# It can: 
#  > Sync data with other software used by the waste company. 
#  > Ensure compatibility with various hardware components. 
#  > Facilitate data exchange between different systems. 
#
# Implementation Steps: 
#  1. Assessment: Evaluate the existing systems and identify integration points.
#  2. API Development: Develop APIs to facilitate data exchange between the new 
#     system and existing systems. 
#  3. Data Mapping: Map data fields between systems to ensure compatibility. 
#  4. Testing: Conduct rigorous testing to ensure seamless integration. 
#  5. Deployment: Deploy the integration and monitor for any issues. 
#
# Tools and Technologies --> 
#  > API Development:
#      a. RESTful APIs using Flask or Django for Python
#      b. Express for Node.js
#  > Data Mapping: Tools like Talend or Apache Nifi for data integration
#  > Testing:
